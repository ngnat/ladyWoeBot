# Lady WoeBot


Lady WoeBot, or Lady Woe for short, is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) chatbot.  CBT is a form of talk therapy that aims to bring you closer to the truth.  By identifying and changing destructive thought patterns, CBT creates a healthier way to think, react, and behave when it comes to your emotions and thoughts.  

Built with React-Redux, Express and Dialogflow, Lady Woe is inspired by how CBT changed my life.  Based on your responses to her questions, Lady Woe is programmed to identify the cognitive distortions you suffer from most.  She will then walk you through a series of thought exercises tailored to your distortion that will ultimately challenge your core beliefs and perceptions.  With Lady WoeBot, I hope to share how eye-opening and healing CBT is.
